### Solved Bugs

* Fixed a bug where the while loop at the beginning continued to loop or was only printing the valid statement once with the break keyword. In order to fix this I used the try and except methods in the while loop, which checked to see if the conditions were met. If they were the code would run, unless there was a value error which would then  print out the else statement. Asking the user to use the correct format the loop would keep running until the else statement was met.
* Fixed a bug where the user couldn't enter a lowercase value. In order to fix this I added the .upper method to the start variable, which converted each string input to an uppercase value which passed the if validation fixing this issue.
